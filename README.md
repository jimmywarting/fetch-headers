```javascript
const Headers = require('fetch-headers')

header = new Headers([
  ['accept', 'application/json']
  ['accept', 'text/plain']
])
```

Notes
-----
This use
 - [WeakMap][1] for private properties
 - [Symbol.iterator][2] and Generators* for iteration
 - vanilla ecmascript 6
 - no transpiler
 - no coffeescript or typescript


Up to date node version can just use this as is. (tested in v6.5.0)<br>
Browsers should run this through closer-compiler, babel, Babili, browserify, webpack or equivalent.<br>
Browsers need to include a polyfill for WeakMap if necessary.<br>

Optional for those who want es5 version and don't have the time or effort to compile can use the prebuilt version
```javascript
var Headers = require('fetch-headers/headers-es5.min.js')
```
